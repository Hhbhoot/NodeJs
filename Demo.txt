Open a File: The fs.open() method is used to create, read, or write a file. The
fs.readFile() method is only for reading the file and fs.writeFile() method is
only for writing to the file, whereas the fs.open() method does several
operations on a file. First, we need to load the fs class which is a module to
access the physical file system.
fs.open(path, f
Parameters:
● path: It holds the name of the file to read or the entire path if stored
at other locations.
● flags: Flags indicate the behaviour of the file to be opened. All
possible values are ( r, r+, rs, rs+, w, wx, w+, wx+, a, ax, a+, ax+).
● mode: Sets the mode of file i.e. r-read, w-write, r+ -readwrite. It is
set to default as readwrite.
● err: If any error occurs.
● data: Contents of the file. It is called after the open operation is
executed.
